      "Sales Description": "Exilis Elite™ is an effective non-invasive skin tightening treatment with no down time. This is the only face skin tightening and body sculpting technology that uses radio frequency (RF) technology to tighten skin and enhance collagen and elastin production.\nEXILIS ELITE™ BENEFITS\n\nFeatures and Benefits: \n• Monopolar depth of penetration\n• Body shaping and Skin tightening \n• Excellent Wrinkle Reduction\n• Safest RF Device available (EFC)\n• Advanced controlled cooling\n• Best control on applicators\n• Painless with high power\n• Fastest treatment times\n• No disposable costs\n\nHOW BTL EXILIS ELITE™ WORKS\nExilis skin tightening uses radio frequency technology to target specific body parts, while controlling the amount of energy focused on a single area. Exilis Elite focuses and forces heat deeply into the skin, while using a cooling technology to provide maximum comfort during the treatment.\nWhen the heat penetrates the skin, the surrounding fat cells overheat and then eventually die. The dead fat cells are then flushed out through the lymphatic system. And even more importantly, the heat stimulates the production of collagen, which tightens skin, reduces wrinkles and adds volume back into the skin.",

The device includes 2 maniples, that can be used independently, or combined in one procedure.\n\nGOLD MICRO NEEDLE manipulator, allows you to work by microneedling. In this case, gold-coated needles enter a predetermined depth and activate the signal that heats the tissue under the action of RF currents. This system is one of the most effective, because in addition to the action of heat, the needles create Micro-columns for the introduction of active agents, and the procedure replaces fractional mesotherapy. Tissue trauma provides additional regeneration and significantly increases the efficiency of the treatment. Thus, the radio frequency not only works for rejuvenation, but also allows you to effectively deal with post-acne, scars. Depth adjustment up to 3 mm makes it possible to work not only with the face, but also with the body.\n\nMATRIX NON NEEDLE gentle warm-up manipulator without tissue trauma. The minula is equipped with 144 electrodes, which, when combined, create a matrix. The matrix electrode system provides stable and guaranteed heating at the level of collagen and elastin.\n\nManipules can be combined in one procedure, when the operator is first preparing the skin with the MATRIX NON NEEDLE manipulator, and then treating the area with the needling manipulator, additionally introducing active preparations. Enhanced heat storage provides a prolonged and long-lasting result.",

      "Sales Description": "The specialist treats the skin surface with a gel and tightly pressing the sensor sends impulses to it. The device releases highly concentrated ultrasonic energy that is delivered deep into the skin causing very precise thermal coagulation that reaches the SMAS layer. Delivering tiny deposits of focused ultrasound energy it precisely heats up a specific location in a short period of time. Your skin responds to this energy by stimulating its deep dermal tissue to produce new compact collagen fibres. This, in turn, leads to a gradual tightening and improvement of your skin elasticity and firmness. As the skin tightens, wrinkles and lines become less visible. The texture of the skin is improved as it becomes smooth, shiny and firm.\n\nEasy way to explain how it works: a piece of meat will shrink if you put it on the hot grill. Phenomenon like this is happening when the skin is centered under the heat point and causes the skin lifting and tightening.\n\nAfter the session, redness and slight swelling are noticeable on the skin. They quickly go within an hour.\n\nRESULTS:\nvisible lifting\nclear contours in the lower jaw and neck\nskin tightening\nincreased elasticity of the skin of the cheeks and chin\nsmoothed nasolabial folds\nThe overhanging skin of the upper eyelids disappears\na new collagen matrix is ​​formed",

The ITONING device is equipped with a signal calibration, which means that all sub-pulses within a single pulse will be stably of the same intensity and power. Filters for the device are made of special durable materials resistant to bumps and scratches. Due to this, the refraction of light through the filter always passes correctly and does not lose its properties and energy. The device is equipped with 4 replaceable filters, which allow for hair removal, rejuvenation, blood vessel removal, pigment removal, treatment of oily skin, acne and post-acne:\n\n640 nm filter for hair removal and skin rejuvenation.\n\n585 nm filter for removing dilated superficial blood vessels, redness, telangiectasias, wine stains (naevus flameus), red moles, skin rejuvenation.\n\n530 nm filter for removing pigmentation of various origins, freckles, coffee stains (café au lait spots), skin color smoothing\n\n430 nm filter for acne and oily skin\n\nThe ITONING device has convenient control and a special TONING program for dynamic operation. Also a distinctive feature is the emission spectrum, in contrast to similar devices, the wavelength is limited to 950 nm (in other models, the emission spectrum is up to 1200 nm and in some models up to 2000). This means applying a certain filter, you work in a narrower light range - and therefore more targeted (for example, 640-950 nm, 585-950 nm, 530-950 nm, 430-950 nm).",

It works best as a local anesthetic injection besides suppressing ventricular tachycardia and ventricular extrasystoles. Dosage should be appropriately adjusted for a patient’s age, anesthetic locations, parts, or diseases affecting the entire body. This solution can be administered by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections.\n\nSo, how to use ?\nIt is slowly administered for 1-2 minutes containing 50-100 mg (1-2mg/kg) of it.\nThe same amount may be given five minutes after the initial injection is done if the desired result is not achieved.\nMoreover, the same dose may be repeated whenever necessary at 10-20 minute intervals, although the maximum dose for 1 hour should not exceed 300 mg.\nIf a single IV administration is successful and you desire long-lasting results, you should provide by IV installation while an ongoing ECG is being monitored. I.V. administration of lidocaine HCl is carried out at a rate of 1–2 mg per minute.\nThe infusion rate may be raised if necessary, but the maximum rate is 4 mg per minute.",

There is a disadvantage that all of them are lost within one to two months after the treatment since low density filler should be used for HA filler on the bags under the eyes. But synergy effect for maximizing the treatment and increasing the duration can be demonstrated by combining i-Filler of White Medience with HA Filler.\n\n• Blunt cannula and twister thread\n• Minimize bruises and swelling\n",
